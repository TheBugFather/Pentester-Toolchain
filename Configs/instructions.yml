# The commands below all feature the capability of using parsing delimiters to dynamically format ip's, ports, etc.
# Available delimiters:
# <ip> - Parse in ip address
# <port> - Parse in port number
# <path> - Parse in path to custom programs where the program name is not the first member, like python scripts. (custom_commands ONLY)
#          If not specified, it is assumed that the path to the custom program should be prepended to the beginning of the command.


# It is only necessary to explain one of the services below since they all work the same

# TCP based ports #
